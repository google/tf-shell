# Note: TensorFlow uses distutils which has recently been provided by setuputils
# but setuputils is no longer included with python 3.12.
#   https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/95299
#   https://github.com/pypa/get-pip/pull/218
# There is an open PR in TensorFlow to remove the dependency on distutils:
